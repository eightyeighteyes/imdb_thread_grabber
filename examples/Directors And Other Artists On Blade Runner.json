I hear there's a new DVD coming out with three different versions, and I'm waiting for that, because the original cut has become unavailable.\r<br>It's more in the film noir tradition to have a narrated voice -- and you kind of need it to pull the elements together.

It\u0092s the stew of the future and getting to see that which draws us into science fiction. Sleep Dealer is competitive with any sci-fi at that level. Its ideas of the future are more true, I think, than the ideas in Blade Runner.\r Interviewer: I\u0092ve long felt that the futuristic city depicted in Blade Runner is a false city because we all know it would be more Chicano than Chinese; it\u0092s ethnically imprecise.\r Alex Rivera: [Laughs.] Exactly. But Blade Runner and so many other science fictions tell us about a future where robots are built to work and all of a sudden they rebel and want to kill people. Then Harrison Ford or Will Smith or somebody has to kill the robots. Intellectually, that\u0092s what they give us. What Sleep Dealer gives us is a lot more true.

It\u0092s the stew of the future and getting to see that which draws us into science fiction. Sleep Dealer is competitive with any sci-fi at that level. Its ideas of the future are more true, I think, than the ideas in Blade Runner.\r<br> <br><b>Interviewer</b>: I\u0092ve long felt that the futuristic city depicted in Blade Runner is a false city because we all know it would be more Chicano than Chinese; it\u0092s ethnically imprecise.\r<br> <br><b>Alex Rivera</b>: [Laughs.] Exactly. But Blade Runner and so many other science fictions tell us about a future where robots are built to work and all of a sudden they rebel and want to kill people. Then Harrison Ford or Will Smith or somebody has to kill the robots. Intellectually, that\u0092s what they give us. What Sleep Dealer gives us is a lot more true. It\u0092s a lot more real and a lot more imaginable. In terms of the ideas, Sleep Dealer is competitive with any science fiction film.\r<br> <br> <br> <br>Clearly a case of a director 'quoting' Blade Runner to promote his own film.\r<br> <br> <br>Alex</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n</div>",

I never saw Logan's Run.\r Kurtzman: But Blade Runner was deeply in our consciousness. Science fiction can be very distancing, and in this case they're exploring what it means to be a human.

On to another director (and writers)\r<br> <br>Interview with <b>Michael Bay</b> and writers on his film <i>The Island</i> by Mike Szmanski at scifi.com\r<br> <br><b>Szmanski</b>: What were some of the science-fiction influences in this story? Obviously people will make comparisons to <i>Blade Runner</i> and <i>Logan's Run</i>, and some from writer Philip K. Dick. Did screenwriters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci go back and look at some of those movies?\r<br> <br><b>Bay</b>: <i>Logan's Run</i>, sure, there will be some comparisons. I haven't seen that film since I was a kid, so I wasn't consciously aware of it.\r<br> <br><b>Orci</b>: We knew we were going to deal with this subject matter at some point or other, so we did some research, but we didn't necessarily go back and look at every cloning movie ever done, and there aren't that many, really. I never saw Logan's Run.\r<br> <br><b>Kurtzman</b>: But <i>Blade Runner</i> was deeply in our consciousness. Science fiction can be very distancing, and in this case they're exploring what it means to be a human. That's where we started from; we started with a guy who goes to work every day and realizes there's something very wrong with his life. And, yes, there's no doubt Philip K. Dick is an influence.\r<br> <br><i>Have a better one...</i></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n</div>",

Why the large budget?\r The Coens wanted to build large sets and use elaborate special effects. They had screened Blade Runner (1982) before making The Hudsucker Proxy, which also used elaborate sets and a large, detailed cityscape. Twenty-seven craftsmen spent three months building a '50s New York skyline, constructing fourteen skyscrapers.

Why the large budget?\r<br> <br>The Coens wanted to build large sets and use elaborate special effects. They had screened Blade Runner (1982) before making The Hudsucker Proxy, which also used elaborate sets and a large, detailed cityscape. Twenty-seven craftsmen spent three months building a '50s New York skyline, constructing fourteen skyscrapers. The movie's skyline was based on photographs from a book that Dennis Gassner found called, New York in the Forties and the scale after Citizen Kane (1941).<hr/></br></br></hr></blockquote> <br>From: <a href=\"http://www.youknow-forkids.com/coenbrothersfaq.pdf\">http://www.youknow-forkids.com/coenbrothersfaq.pdf</a> <br> <br><i>~We don't see things as they are, but as we are~</i></br></br></br></div>\n</div>",

Probably my favorite movie of all time would be Blade Runner. \r The director\u0092s cut or the original version?\r Brian Clark: Oh, definitely the director\u0092s cut. No narration, no Mickey Spillane voice-over with the extra wrinkle that the Blade Runner\u0092s a replicant (Oh, no, spoiler alert! Spoiler alert! I spoiled the movie!)\r Did you see the narrated version first?\r Brian Clark: Yes.\r Do you think that made you appreciate the second one better?\r Brian Clark: No. I think once they took the voice-over out, it left more to speculation. Peoples\u0092 motivations and machines\u0092 motivations became less clear. We didn\u0092t need to have Harrison Ford tell us about Rutger Hauer dying. We could just watch that scene and not have to say, \u0093Maybe in the end he valued any life, even his own.\u0094 I think that the film company underestimated the intelligence of the film-going public.\r I read somewhere that Harrison Ford said he did the narration badly deliberately so they\u0092d have to cut it.\r Brian Clark: Really? That\u0092s a great detail - a little sabotage.\r True, but I don\u0092t know whether it\u0092s an urban myth or not.\r Brian Clark: Yeah, but it\u0092s interesting.\r    Editor\u0092s note: For those of you who played Art of the Heist last year, or who are currently enjoying Who Is Benjamin Stove?, you might already know about GMD Studios, the driving force behind some of the biggest Alternate Reality Games to date.

Probably my favorite movie of all time would be Blade Runner. \r<br> <br>The director\u0092s cut or the original version?\r<br> <br><b>Brian Clark</b>: Oh, definitely the director\u0092s cut. No narration, no Mickey Spillane voice-over with the extra wrinkle that the Blade Runner\u0092s a replicant (Oh, no, spoiler alert! Spoiler alert! I spoiled the movie!)\r<br> <br>Did you see the narrated version first?\r<br> <br><b>Brian Clark</b>: Yes.\r<br> <br>Do you think that made you appreciate the second one better?\r<br> <br><b>Brian Clark</b>: No. I think once they took the voice-over out, it left more to speculation. Peoples\u0092 motivations and machines\u0092 motivations became less clear. We didn\u0092t need to have Harrison Ford tell us about Rutger Hauer dying. We could just watch that scene and not have to say, \u0093Maybe in the end he valued any life, even his own.\u0094 I think that the film company underestimated the intelligence of the film-going public.\r<br> <br>I read somewhere that Harrison Ford said he did the narration badly deliberately so they\u0092d have to cut it.\r<br> <br><b>Brian Clark</b>: Really? That\u0092s a great detail - a little sabotage.\r<br> <br>True, but I don\u0092t know whether it\u0092s an urban myth or not.\r<br> <br><b>Brian Clark</b>: Yeah, but it\u0092s interesting.\r<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Editor\u0092s note: For those of you who played Art of the Heist last year, or who are currently enjoying Who Is Benjamin Stove?, you might already know about GMD Studios, the driving force behind some of the biggest Alternate Reality Games to date.

I just don't think there have been many great science fiction films made. I mean, 2001 is genius, there's no question it's a masterpiece, but I've already picked a Kubrick film.

Part of the creative process in writing the album was, if I ever felt depleted, I'd go to I Luv Video and then stay up and watch movies. \r<br> <br><a href=\"http://www.avclub.com/austin/articles/fun-fun-fun-fest-between-blade-runner-and-sonic-th,34802/\">http://www.avclub.com/austin/articles/fun-fun-fun-fest-between-blade-r unner-and-sonic-th,34802/</a> <br> <br><b><font color=\"blue\"><i>Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  </i></font></b></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n</div>",

I mean, today I did a picture and sound check for the screening tomorrow and I saw something new that I hadn't spotted before and I had seen the film hundreds of times. So that's--it's like this kind of puzzle that you keep coming back to. There's always a different way to solve it, there's always a different angle you can take when you see it. Additionally the film is so influential with other film makers. Immediately after Blade Runner you started seeing not only other science fiction films and commercials and music videos, comp books, was just--you know, ripple effect, that you started seeing neon steam and rain. It was always kind of like we're going to have some visual cliches. But back then they were really striking. And there's this interesting shorthand to the future that really had figured out that he kind of started with the Alien but definitely kind of blew out of the water with Blade Runner. So even though Blade Runner kind of faded away on its first release, it was still alive through these other film makers that were kind of copying it or paying homage to it along the way. And on top of that you look at the real work and it's like becoming slowly like Blade Runner. I mean look at Times Square. I mean that's Blade Runner.

One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Rutger Hauer is about to die, and he says to Harrison Ford, \"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.\" It's such a wonderful, tragic line, it's true. All of the stuff that you have accumulated, all this experience, all these loves, all this coffee, all these dogs...as soon as you die, it's just tossed? I can't imagine that it works like that. I think there's probably some repository of this stuff. And that made a kind of sense for me.

One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Rutger Hauer is about to die, and he says to Harrison Ford, \"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.\" It's such a wonderful, tragic line, it's true. All of the stuff that you have accumulated, all this experience, all these loves, all this coffee, all these dogs...as soon as you die, it's just tossed? I can't imagine that it works like that. I think there's probably some repository of this stuff. And that made a kind of sense for me.

Interestingly, my upbringing was kind of Schwarzenegger and Tarkovsky.  And my dad was the one who used to push Tarkovsky on me, so secretly I would watch Schwarzenegger.  \"Robocop\" was a rare movie that he loved because it walked that line.  And Monty Python was like that as well.  You know... there was also Terry Gilliam and \"Brazil\" and \"Clockwork Orange\" and obviously \"Blade Runner\".  All those are the kind of movies that influenced this film.  But definitely the intent was to kind of entertain and at the same time have an underlying social comment that didn\u0092t really hit people over the head with giving its point but was there if you choose to take a closer look.From an interview for HitFix http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/2008-12-6-motion-captured/posts/the-m-c-in terview-repo-men-director-miguel-sapochnik-talks-verhoeven-music-and-m ore   And in another interview with Sapochnik from CinemaBlend.com:And yes, his movie set in a dingy futuristic Los Angeles where people hunt down artificial beings has a little bit of Blade Runner in it too, and he doesn't mind the comparison. \"Better Blade Runner than Demolition Man,\" he told me in our later conversation. In fact he imagines Repo Men as taking place about 25 years before Ridley Scott's seminal sci-fi film, in which people are \"building the foundations of that world.\" The Asian influence in the Los Angeles of Blade Runner becomes an economy completely dominated by China, and the flying cars Deckard uses are still in the prototype phase-- Sapochnik told me his film initially included news reports on more flying car test deaths.From: http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Exclusive-Interview-Repo-Men-Director-M iguel-Sapochnik-17650.html   It might get loud",

In fact he imagines Repo Men as taking place about 25 years before Ridley Scott's seminal sci-fi film, in which people are \"building the foundations of that world.\" The Asian influence in the Los Angeles of Blade Runner becomes an economy completely dominated by China, and the flying cars Deckard uses are still in the prototype phase-- Sapochnik told me his film initially included news reports on more flying car test deaths.<hr/></hr></blockquote>From: <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Exclusive-Interview-Repo-Men-Director-Miguel-Sapochnik-17650.html\">http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Exclusive-Interview-Repo-Men-Director-M iguel-Sapochnik-17650.html</a> <br> <br> <br><b><font color=\"blue\"><i>It might get loud</i></font></b></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n</div>",

There\u0092s not a lot to change, though. With Blade Runner, I knew I\u0092d nailed it really good, or I thought I had, but I hadn\u0092t because no one got it except for a few loony diehards. In fact, the Wachowski brothers were asked about it recently and they said: \u0093Of course we *beep* liked it\u0085 but no one else did.\u0094 So, they were being complimentary and bitchy at the same time. So I say that what they did was copy Blade Runner\u0085 it obviously influenced everything they do. So they can stick that up their pipe and smoke it.\r Anyway, I knew what I did but because we were obliged to do audience research, where you screen the movie before you finish it, they were sitting there, fidgeting and then decided: \u0093It\u0092s a depressing ending.\u0094 They also asked: \u0093What is city speak?\u0094 Well, you find that out during the movie unless you\u0092re half a moron. But now we had to put on a voice-over and that silly ending where they drive off into those beautiful mountains. If you had that beautiful countryside, though, why the *beep* would you live in that city? It didn\u0092t make any sense. So, all I did was remove the voice-over, remove the ending, polish up the blacks that had faded a little bit in 25 years and it looked like it was made yesterday.\r       Alex",

There\u0092s not a lot to change, though. With Blade Runner, I knew I\u0092d nailed it really good, or I thought I had, but I hadn\u0092t because no one got it except for a few loony diehards. In fact, the Wachowski brothers were asked about it recently and they said: \u0093Of course we *beep* liked it\u0085 but no one else did.\u0094 So, they were being complimentary and bitchy at the same time. So I say that what they did was copy Blade Runner\u0085 it obviously influenced everything they do. So they can stick that up their pipe and smoke it.\r<br> <br>Anyway, I knew what I did but because we were obliged to do audience research, where you screen the movie before you finish it, they were sitting there, fidgeting and then decided: \u0093It\u0092s a depressing ending.\u0094 They also asked: \u0093What is city speak?\u0094 Well, you find that out during the movie unless you\u0092re half a moron. But now we had to put on a voice-over and that silly ending where they drive off into those beautiful mountains. If you had that beautiful countryside, though, why the *beep* would you live in that city? It didn\u0092t make any sense. So, all I did was remove the voice-over, remove the ending, polish up the blacks that had faded a little bit in 25 years and it looked like it was made yesterday.\r<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Alex</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n</div>",

    "content": "George R.R. Martin Picks His Favorite Science-Fiction Films of All Time\r George R.R. Martin  \u0096 Thu Mar 31, 12:38 am ET\rNEW YORK \u0096 Game of Thrones, HBO\u0092s adaptation of George R.R. Martin\u0092s first book in his bestselling series, premieres April 17\u0097and the network is showing the first 15 minutes of the first episode this Sunday. In anticipation, the writer curates his 10 favorite science-fiction films, from The Road Warrior to Blade Runner. And check back next week, when Martin curates his favorite fantasy films.\r 1. Forbidden Planet (1956)\rThe Tempest on Altair IV. The only science-fiction film that William Shakespeare ever wrote (admittedly with some help from screenwriter Cyril Hume). The Bard of Avon and Robby the Robot make a combination that has still yet to be surpassed. Leslie Nielsen plays Captain Kirk a decade before William Shatner, and does it better. In fact, the C-57-D and its command trio of captain, first officer, and doctor are clear forerunners of the Enterprise and its Kirk/Spock/Bones triad, though none of Kirk\u0092s myriad love interests could hold a candle to Anne Francis as the sexy yet innocent Altaira. It\u0092s Walter Pidgeon who steals the film, however. His layered portrayal of the tormented Morbius is almost\u0085 well\u0085 Shakespearean. And did I mention Robby the Robot? Forbidden Planet was his first film role, but Robby went on to make numerous appearances in other movies and television episodes, a career that R2D2, C3PO, and Robocop can only envy. Forbidden Planet\u0092s visuals and special effects were state of the art in their day, and still hold up pretty well\u0085 especially the sequence where the invisible Id monster gets caught in the disintegrator beams. The score was also amazing and unique, done in electronic tonalities that remain as unsettling as they were revolutionary. I hear rumors that they are going to remake this. Please, no.\r 2. Aliens (1986)\rOnce upon a time, Robert A. Heinlein wrote a classic (and controversial) science-fiction novel called Starship Troopers, which is still being read and argued about today. Many years later, director Paul Verhoeven and writer Edward Neumeier made a very bad film called Starship Troopers. Fortunately RAH was dead by then and never had to see it. In between, James Cameron made Aliens. According to Hollywood legend, when Cameron heard that they were going to film Starship Troopers, he said, \u0093Why bother? I\u0092ve done it.\u0094 And, you know, he had. His film was not based on the novel Starship Troopers, of course, but his Colonial Marines come a lot closer to the spirit and feel of Heinlein\u0092s Mobile Infantry than anything in the Verhoeven movie, while still remaining true to the Alien franchise. Aliens is one of the rare cases of a sequel that was actually better than the original (no mean trick here, since the original was pretty damned good). This is probably Sigourney Weaver\u0092s best turn as Ripley, though all of them were good. Her supporting cast was great as well: Hicks (Michael Biehn), Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein), the heroic android Bishop (Lance Henriksen), and especially Newt, as played by Carrie Henn. \u0093Will I dream?\u0094 Newt asks Ripley in the last scene of the film, just before they settle down into their capsules for a long, cold sleep. \u0093Yes\u0094 would be my answer. If they ever put me in charge of the franchise, the next Alien film will open with Newt waking up safe on Earth, having dreamed all those later, awful Alien movies.\r 3. Blade Runner (1982) Poor Philip K. Dick. One of the true geniuses of science fiction, he struggled all his life to find an audience, and never had two nickels to rub together. Then, after he dies, he gets discovered by Hollywood, and film after film after film follows. Total Recall, A Scanner Darkly, Minority Report, The Adjustment Bureau, and more on the way. But Blade Runner was the first Dick film and remains the best. Based on Dick\u0092s novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, with a title borrowed from an unrelated novel by Alan Nourse, Blade Runner gave film audiences an entirely new vision of what the future might hold, very different from the sterile universe of Star Trek and its ilk. This was a gritty, dirty, dark tomorrow where it seemed to rain day and night, brought to vivid life by Ridley Scott\u0092s superb direction, Syd Mead\u0092s amazing production designs, and a script by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples that even Dick might have liked. Forget the theatrical release, with its hokey voice-overs and tacked-on happy ending. To get the true impact of this one, the director\u0092s cut is the only way to go. I still get a chill listening to Rutger Hauer\u0092s final speech. \u0093I\u0092ve seen things you people wouldn\u0092t believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I\u0092ve watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in the rain. Time to die.\u0094\r 4. Alien (1979)\rSome purists will argue that Alien is really a horror film in science-fiction drag, and maybe they have a point. But it\u0092s a great horror film in science-fiction drag. The look of the film was unique; we had never seen a spaceship like the Nostromo before, though you have to wonder about all those dripping pipes\u0097did this starship run on steam? H.R. Giger\u0092s alien designs made \u0093Gigeresque\u0094 an adjective. The blue-collar down-and-dirty crew seemed like real people. The chest-burster scene is strong stuff even today, and those who saw it in the theaters without knowing what was coming, like me, will never forget it. Tom Skerritt\u0092s death packed almost as much punch (a chorus of \u0093Wait a minute, I thought Dallas was the hero\u0094 was heard across the land). After that, you knew that no one was safe. And then there was the life-pod scene, Ripley in her underwear and the Alien in the pipes, sex and horror mashed together. From where I sit, Ripley is the defining role of Sigourney Weaver\u0092s career. The fact that she never won an Oscar for Ripley just underlines the sad truth that the Academy does not honor actors for roles in science-fiction or fantasy films, no matter how good they are. (The single conspicuous exception will be dealt with when I get to my Honorable Mentions.)\r 5. Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)\rThere have been four versions of this story filmed to date, all deriving from the original Jack Finney novel, though I doubt the makers of the three remakes are familiar with anything beyond the original film. Every time they remake it, it gets worse. The second film, the 1978 Philip Kaufman version with Donald Sutherland, Leonard Nimoy, and Jeff Goldblum, is not half bad. Let\u0092s be kind and pretend that Body Snatchers (1993) and The Invasion (2007) do not exist. It\u0092s only the 1956 original that belongs on this list. A classic tale of creeping Red Scare paranoia and alien invasion, full of fathers who aren\u0092t fathers, husbands who aren\u0092t husbands, wives who aren\u0092t wives, director Don Siegel\u0092s film made a whole generation afraid to go to sleep, and contributed the phrase \u0093pod people\u0094 to the idiom. The ending, with a crazed Kevin McCarthy standing on the highway shouting, \u0093You\u0092re next,\u0094 at passing cars, came as a real shock to the filmgoers of the 1950s, who expected happy endings in their monster movies.\r 6. The Road Warrior (1981)\rThe second of the three Mad Max films is by far the best. The original Mad Max was utterly forgettable, and while Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome has some great parts\u0097the Thunderdome itself, Master/Blaster, Tina Turner\u0092s turn as Queen of Bartertown, and the wonderful language of the tribe of lost children\u0097it also recycles some of the best bits of The Road Warrior rather shamelessly. But The Road Warrior has it all. Mel Gibson is perfect as the reluctant hero, but much of the film\u0092s juice comes from its supporting characters: Wez and the Humungous (\u0093the Ayatollah of Rocknrollah!\u0094), the Feral Kid, Pappagallo, the Mechanic, the Warrior Woman (played by Virginia Hey, who would later sign aboard Farscape)\u0085 and best of all, the Gyro Captain, masterfully played by Bruce Spence (\u0093Remember lingerie?\u0094). You have to love the end, where the embittered loner Max remains an embittered loner, while the lecherous cigar-chomping Gyro Captain becomes the new leader of the tribe. Maybe if he\u0092d known that Thunderdome, Tina Turner, and all those pigs were waiting in his future, Max would have made a different decision. \r 7. Dark Star (1974) \rSome indie films are made on low budgets. Dark Star looks as though it was made with whatever loose change John Carpenter and Dan O\u0092Bannon found under their couch cushions. The alien is a beach ball. Half the videos on YouTube have better SFX. Never mind, it is still the funniest science-fiction film ever made. Pinback\u0092s video diary, the whole \u0093Time to Feed the Alien\u0094 sequence, \u0093Let\u0092s Have Some Music in Here, Boiler,\u0094 Lt. Doolittle\u0092s climactic conversation with Bomb 20\u0097any of those segments would be worth the price of admission all by themselves. And then the end, Doolittle on his improvised surfboard, flaming into the atmosphere as \u0093Benson, Arizona\u0094 comes up once again \u0085perfect. \r 8. The War of the Worlds (1953) \rThe George Pal version, if you please. Steven Spielberg\u0092s 2005 remake hews closer to the H.G. Wells novel (and even blows up my hometown of Bayonne, New Jersey!) but loses points for having its aliens (no longer Martians) riding down on lightning bolts to activate tripods they buried thousands of years ago. Excuse me? Whose bright idea was that? In the 1953 version, produced by Pal and directed by Byron Haskin, the Martians (yay!) crash to earth in flaming cylinders, the way God and H.G. Wells intended it. Pal could not do realistic tripods with the special-effects technology available to him in 1953, but the floating \u0093manta ray\u0094 war machines he offered us instead were elegant, ominous, and unforgettable. And the scene where the Flying Wing lifts off to drop the H-bomb on the Martians thrilled and chilled every kid in America. I\u0092ll grant you that the Pal film ends with the biggest deus ex machina in cinematic history, but so does the Spielberg film and every other version. (There have been six to date, but only the Pal and the Spielberg are worth watching.) Can\u0092t be helped. That\u0092s the way H.G. ended the book, too. Now if only someone (Billy Bob Thornton, maybe?) would film Howard Waldrop\u0092s irreverent coda, Night of the Cooters. \r 9. The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) \rThe original version, of course. That thing with Keanu Reaves could not make a list of the top 100 science-fiction films. How do you remake The Day the Earth Stood Still and turn \u0093Klaatu Barada Nikto\u0094 into a mumbled throwaway aside? That\u0092s like remaking Citizen Kane and leaving out Rosebud. Jennifer Connelly, while lovely to look upon, is no Patricia Neal, and Keanu Reaves is certainly no Michael Rennie. Keanu\u0092s acting range more closely approximates that of Gort from the first film. Edmund North\u0092s script for the 1951 original actually improves on its source material, the Harry Bates short story \u0093Farewell to the Master,\u0094 and Robert Wise\u0092s direction is sure-handed and impeccable. There\u0092s a certain sentimentality to the \u009251 film that may come across as hokey to modern audiences, but I find that infinitely preferable to the sour misanthropy of the remake. And the original is intelligent from start to finish, where the remake is relentlessly stupid. \r 10. The Empire Strikes Back (1980) \rIf you have to have a Star Wars film on the list, this is the one. The original Star Wars\u0097I refuse to call it A New Hope\u0097changed the face of movies and science fiction both, though not always in good ways. It has dated rather badly, though. Empire holds up better, perhaps because of the Leigh Brackett script. She was the best writer ever to work on the franchise. The second film gives us more of Han Solo and Darth Vader and less of Luke, which is all to the good. Alec Guinness is missed, but we get Yoda. R2D2 and C3PO are still fun, not yet the annoyances they become in the prequel trilogy. Lucas has yet to conceive of Jar Jar Binks, thank God, and those cuddly cute Ewoks remain a film in the future. The ice planet and the swamp planet and the floating city were all familiar staples of print science fiction, and had been since the heyday of the pulps, but it was a thrill to see them realized on screen for the first time. \r HONORABLE MENTIONS \rWell, there\u0092s Avatar (2009). Amazing special effects, a feast for the eyes, but I liked the story better when they called it Dances With Wolves. Then you have Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), if you like watching Richard Dreyfuss playing with his mashed potatoes. I want to see the movie that starts where Close Encounters ends, the one about the people boarding that starship. Serenity (2005) has a lot to recommend it, but ultimately comes across as what is: the last episode of the ill-fated and much-mourned TV series Firefly. For those who never watched the show, the film has far less impact. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) was the best of the Trek films, but that still doesn\u0092t earn it a place on the list. Maybe if I was doing the Top 20 instead of the Top 10. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is certainly a landmark, a film that students of the cinema, Kubrick fans, and French critics love to analyze and ponder. If only it wasn\u0092t so bloody dull. The only memorable character in the film is the HAL 9000. \r Galaxy Quest\u0085 ah, Galaxy Quest (1999). Maybe I should have put that one in the No. 10 slot, in place of Empire. It\u0092s a Star Trek parody that\u0092s better than any of the Star Trek films. \u0093This episode was very badly written!\u0094 Maybe, but the film was not. A near-miss. A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001) had an amazing array of talent behind it. A script by Ian Watson, based on a story by Brian Aldiss, directed by Steven Spielberg, working with material that Stanley Kubrick had developed for years. They produced a brilliant, haunting, gorgeous, but ultimately flawed masterpiece. This one came close, too. The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) is\u0085 what? Science fiction? Horror? Musical comedy? Cult film? Act along? It is certainly in the Top 10 of whatever the hell it is, once we find a category for it. \r Galaxy Quest, 1999 \rThe only science-fiction film ever to win an Academy Award for acting\u0097science fiction and fantasy have won plenty of Oscars for special effects, makeup, etc.\u0097was Charly (1968). Cliff Robertson took home the Oscar for his performance as Charly Gordon, a role he\u0092d originally performed in a television adaptation of the same story, called The Two Worlds of Charly Gordon. The TV version was based on Flowers for Algernon, the classic short story by Daniel Keyes, the film version (script by Stirling Silliphant) of the novel Keyes made by expanding that story. In both cases, shorter was better. \r Charly, 1968 \r Plus: Check out more of the latest entertainment, fashion, and culture coverage on Sexy Beast\u0097photos, videos, features, and Tweets. \r Author George R.R.

Martin Picks His Favorite Science-Fiction Films of All Time\r<br> <br>George R.R. Martin  \u0096 Thu Mar 31, 12:38 am ET\r<br>NEW YORK \u0096 Game of Thrones, HBO\u0092s adaptation of George R.R. Martin\u0092s first book in his bestselling series, premieres April 17\u0097and the network is showing the first 15 minutes of the first episode this Sunday. In anticipation, the writer curates his 10 favorite science-fiction films, from The Road Warrior to Blade Runner.

Then, after he dies, he gets discovered by Hollywood, and film after film after film follows. Total Recall, A Scanner Darkly, Minority Report, The Adjustment Bureau, and more on the way.

Let\u0092s be kind and pretend that Body Snatchers (1993) and The Invasion (2007) do not exist. It\u0092s only the 1956 original that belongs on this list. A classic tale of creeping Red Scare paranoia and alien invasion, full of fathers who aren\u0092t fathers, husbands who aren\u0092t husbands, wives who aren\u0092t wives, director Don Siegel\u0092s film made a whole generation afraid to go to sleep, and contributed the phrase \u0093pod people\u0094 to the idiom. The ending, with a crazed Kevin McCarthy standing on the highway shouting, \u0093You\u0092re next,\u0094 at passing cars, came as a real shock to the filmgoers of the 1950s, who expected happy endings in their monster movies.\r<br> <br>6. The Road Warrior (1981)\r<br>The second of the three Mad Max films is by far the best. The original Mad Max was utterly forgettable, and while Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome has some great parts\u0097the Thunderdome itself, Master/Blaster, Tina Turner\u0092s turn as Queen of Bartertown, and the wonderful language of the tribe of lost children\u0097it also recycles some of the best bits of The Road Warrior rather shamelessly. But The Road Warrior has it all. Mel Gibson is perfect as the reluctant hero, but much of the film\u0092s juice comes from its supporting characters: Wez and the Humungous (\u0093the Ayatollah of Rocknrollah!\u0094), the Feral Kid, Pappagallo, the Mechanic, the Warrior Woman (played by Virginia Hey, who would later sign aboard Farscape)\u0085 and best of all, the Gyro Captain, masterfully played by Bruce Spence (\u0093Remember lingerie?\u0094). You have to love the end, where the embittered loner Max remains an embittered loner, while the lecherous cigar-chomping Gyro Captain becomes the new leader of the tribe. Maybe if he\u0092d known that Thunderdome, Tina Turner, and all those pigs were waiting in his future, Max would have made a different decision. \r<br> <br>7. Dark Star (1974) \r<br>Some indie films are made on low budgets. Dark Star looks as though it was made with whatever loose change John Carpenter and Dan O\u0092Bannon found under their couch cushions. The alien is a beach ball. Half the videos on YouTube have better SFX. Never mind, it is still the funniest science-fiction film ever made. Pinback\u0092s video diary, the whole \u0093Time to Feed the Alien\u0094 sequence, \u0093Let\u0092s Have Some Music in Here, Boiler,\u0094 Lt. Doolittle\u0092s climactic conversation with Bomb 20\u0097any of those segments would be worth the price of admission all by themselves. And then the end, Doolittle on his improvised surfboard, flaming into the atmosphere as \u0093Benson, Arizona\u0094 comes up once again \u0085perfect. \r<br> <br>8. The War of the Worlds (1953) \r<br>The George Pal version, if you please. Steven Spielberg\u0092s 2005 remake hews closer to the H.G. Wells novel (and even blows up my hometown of Bayonne, New Jersey!) but loses points for having its aliens (no longer Martians) riding down on lightning bolts to activate tripods they buried thousands of years ago. Excuse me? Whose bright idea was that? In the 1953 version, produced by Pal and directed by Byron Haskin, the Martians (yay!) crash to earth in flaming cylinders, the way God and H.G. Wells intended it. Pal could not do realistic tripods with the special-effects technology available to him in 1953, but the floating \u0093manta ray\u0094 war machines he offered us instead were elegant, ominous, and unforgettable. And the scene where the Flying Wing lifts off to drop the H-bomb on the Martians thrilled and chilled every kid in America. I\u0092ll grant you that the Pal film ends with the biggest deus ex machina in cinematic history, but so does the Spielberg film and every other version. (There have been six to date, but only the Pal and the Spielberg are worth watching.) Can\u0092t be helped. That\u0092s the way H.G. ended the book, too. Now if only someone (Billy Bob Thornton, maybe?) would film Howard Waldrop\u0092s irreverent coda, Night of the Cooters. \r<br> <br>9. The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) \r<br>The original version, of course. That thing with Keanu Reaves could not make a list of the top 100 science-fiction films. How do you remake The Day the Earth Stood Still and turn \u0093Klaatu Barada Nikto\u0094 into a mumbled throwaway aside? That\u0092s like remaking Citizen Kane and leaving out Rosebud. Jennifer Connelly, while lovely to look upon, is no Patricia Neal, and Keanu Reaves is certainly no Michael Rennie. Keanu\u0092s acting range more closely approximates that of Gort from the first film. Edmund North\u0092s script for the 1951 original actually improves on its source material, the Harry Bates short story \u0093Farewell to the Master,\u0094 and Robert Wise\u0092s direction is sure-handed and impeccable. There\u0092s a certain sentimentality to the \u009251 film that may come across as hokey to modern audiences, but I find that infinitely preferable to the sour misanthropy of the remake. And the original is intelligent from start to finish, where the remake is relentlessly stupid. \r<br> <br>10. The Empire Strikes Back (1980) \r<br>If you have to have a Star Wars film on the list, this is the one. The original Star Wars\u0097I refuse to call it A New Hope\u0097changed the face of movies and science fiction both, though not always in good ways. It has dated rather badly, though. Empire holds up better, perhaps because of the Leigh Brackett script. She was the best writer ever to work on the franchise. The second film gives us more of Han Solo and Darth Vader and less of Luke, which is all to the good. Alec Guinness is missed, but we get Yoda. R2D2 and C3PO are still fun, not yet the annoyances they become in the prequel trilogy. Lucas has yet to conceive of Jar Jar Binks, thank God, and those cuddly cute Ewoks remain a film in the future. The ice planet and the swamp planet and the floating city were all familiar staples of print science fiction, and had been since the heyday of the pulps, but it was a thrill to see them realized on screen for the first time. \r<br> <br>HONORABLE MENTIONS \r<br>Well, there\u0092s Avatar (2009). Amazing special effects, a feast for the eyes, but I liked the story better when they called it Dances With Wolves. Then you have Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), if you like watching Richard Dreyfuss playing with his mashed potatoes. I want to see the movie that starts where Close Encounters ends, the one about the people boarding that starship. Serenity (2005) has a lot to recommend it, but ultimately comes across as what is: the last episode of the ill-fated and much-mourned TV series Firefly. For those who never watched the show, the film has far less impact. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) was the best of the Trek films, but that still doesn\u0092t earn it a place on the list. Maybe if I was doing the Top 20 instead of the Top 10. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is certainly a landmark, a film that students of the cinema, Kubrick fans, and French critics love to analyze and ponder. If only it wasn\u0092t so bloody dull. The only memorable character in the film is the HAL 9000. \r<br> <br>Galaxy Quest\u0085 ah, Galaxy Quest (1999). Maybe I should have put that one in the No. 10 slot, in place of Empire. It\u0092s a Star Trek parody that\u0092s better than any of the Star Trek films. \u0093This episode was very badly written!\u0094 Maybe, but the film was not. A near-miss. A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001) had an amazing array of talent behind it. A script by Ian Watson, based on a story by Brian Aldiss, directed by Steven Spielberg, working with material that Stanley Kubrick had developed for years. They produced a brilliant, haunting, gorgeous, but ultimately flawed masterpiece. This one came close, too. The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) is\u0085 what? Science fiction? Horror? Musical comedy? Cult film? Act along? It is certainly in the Top 10 of whatever the hell it is, once we find a category for it. \r<br> <br>Galaxy Quest, 1999 \r<br>The only science-fiction film ever to win an Academy Award for acting\u0097science fiction and fantasy have won plenty of Oscars for special effects, makeup, etc.\u0097was Charly (1968). Cliff Robertson took home the Oscar for his performance as Charly Gordon, a role he\u0092d originally performed in a television adaptation of the same story, called The Two Worlds of Charly Gordon. The TV version was based on Flowers for Algernon, the classic short story by Daniel Keyes, the film version (script by Stirling Silliphant) of the novel Keyes made by expanding that story. In both cases, shorter was better. \r<br> <br>Charly, 1968 \r<br> <br>Plus: Check out more of the latest entertainment, fashion, and culture coverage on Sexy Beast\u0097photos, videos, features, and Tweets. \r<br> <br>Author George R.R.

Not only is it difficult to imagine the immaculately be-suited director sitting before us swathed in a caftan, his unique amalgam of slo-mo bloodletting and operatic ultra violence would seem to be a world away from the herb-scented air of the Age Of Aquarius. But, in fact, closer examination reveals that there is indeed a soft, humanistic centre to Woo\u0092s violently stylish edge. As an action director he is unique in constantly pursuing the same themes of friendship, honour, betrayal, fidelity and true love, albeit via the medium of billowing explosions and people flying through plate-glass windows. Oh, and doves. Lots of doves. \u0093I like doves,\u0094 Woo announces, somewhat redundantly. \u0093They look so beautiful, like a woman. For me they represent peace and love and purity. And sometimes they\u0092re seen as the messengers of God, so they\u0092re important to me because I\u0092m a Christian.\u0094 But for this outing Woo has toned the avian content to just one solitary feathered friend, and he\u0092s also pulled back on the traditional \u0091Woo factor\u0092. There\u0092s very little slo-mo, only a couple of restrained, double-handed Mexican stand-offs and the odd freeze frame. Is he losing his touch? \u0093I\u0092ve been trying to make the action more realistic,\u0094 he says. \u0093It\u0092s deliberate. It\u0092s a story about an ordinary man, so I held back a little bit.\u0094 And then there\u0092s the concern that for the past decade or so, almost every action director of note has been ripping Woo off (or paying homage, if you\u0092re being polite). For good or ill, The Matrix trilogy\u0092s blend of kinetic action, hectic editing and surreal wire-work, as well as its fetishisation of fire-arms, are unthinkable without Woo. As is Robert Rodriguez\u0092s Mariachi trilogy. In fact, it\u0092s arguable that no foreign director has had as profound an influence on the style of American popular cinema since the Movie Brats donned their black roll-necks and decided to check out this Truffaut guy. But is he bothered by this kind of shameless pilfering? \u0093I think we all help each other,\u0094 he remarks diplomatically. \u0093To be honest, I\u0092m pretty happy about it. When I was young I learned so much by watching other people\u0092s films, David Lean, Hitchcock, and Kurasawa. We had no film schools in Hong Kong so you had to learn by seeing movies. And now, maybe some young people are learning things from my movies.\u0094 Adapted from the Philip K. Dick novel, Paycheck reprises the common Dickensian themes of memory and identity with its impressively paradox-riddled tale of a man who reverse-engineers technology for large corporations before having his memory wiped in order to protect their intellectual copyright. There\u0092s also the familiar element of a machine that can view the future (see Minority Report). It\u0092s Woo\u0092s first foray into pure science-fiction \u0096 if you don\u0092t count the loopy speculative technology in trading faces drama Face/Off \u0096 and it\u0092s a genre he approached with some trepidation, particularly since Dick has been adapted by two of American cinema\u0092s undisputed heavyweights. \u0093I\u0092m not a good sci-fi director \u0096 I\u0092m not as good as Ridley Scott with Blade Runner or Steven Spielberg with Minority Report,\u0094 he says. \u0093Those are great movies. Originally Paycheck was a very hi-tech screenplay, but I just decided to do it simply. You know, I don\u0092t know much at all about computers or technology, so I got rid of all but a little of the futuristic element and focused on the human story.\u0094 The human story in question is that of Michael Jennings (Affleck), who on completing a two-year job expects a massive pay-off, but instead gets an envelope full of unrelated objects which he has apparently sent to himself. Woo\u0092s casting of Affleck nods towards Cary Grant\u0092s dapper but bewildered Roger O. Thornhill in North By Northwest (in fact, the film is packed with Hitchcock references). \u0093I love Ben since I saw him in Good Will Hunting,\u0094 says Woo. \u0093He\u0092s a fine filmmaker, too.\u0094 All of which makes it a bit awkward when it turns out that Ben Affleck actually wasn\u0092t Woo\u0092s first choice for the role at all. \u0093Ah, no\u0085\u0094 he murmurs, apparently reluctant to proceed any further. Who was it then? \u0093Ah, er um\u0085 Matt Damon,\u0094 he winces. \u0093Yeah, Matt was the one who heard about it,\u0094 breezes Ben Affleck, apparently utterly unfazed by the notion of accepting the cinematic equivalent of his pal\u0092s sloppy seconds. \u0093Matt called me up and said, \u0091You know I got this script, it\u0092s John Woo.\u0092 Woo had seen The Bourne Identity and thought of Matt for it. But Matt said it was too similar for him to do it, dealing with the amnesia aspect. But he said it was a really good script. That\u0092s what it\u0092s like with Matt. It\u0092s nice having a friend in the industry that you can bounce ideas off without them having some agenda or other.\u0094 It\u0092s not the first actioner in which Affleck has gotten himself involved. Both Armageddon and Pearl Harbor attempted to shoehorn Affleck into the matin\u00e9e-idol mould. The experience has not always proved pleasant. \u0093The difference between Michael Bay and John Woo?\u0094 Affleck ponders as Empire requests a snap compare and contrast between the two directors. \u0093Well, John Woo is a gentleman and a prince, and Michael Bay is like this 13 year-old *beep* he concludes. \u0093He\u0092s sort of screaming all the time. It makes it hard. Some people \u0096 and not just Michael \u0096 feel the need to create drama and tension and anxiety to get what they want. And Woo demonstrates that this is not true. He\u0092s the sweetest, humblest, most decent man.\u0094 \u0085 Paycheck should stand as a model example of why a director shouldn\u0092t try to be something he or she\u0092s not. If he\u0092s going to do it, DON\u0092T hold back! Don\u0092t step outside your stylistic element/sensibilities! Stamp your fingerprints all over it! Go crazy! Yeah, people would\u0092ve still complained but at least the pic would\u0092ve been remembered as a cool curiosity and not a forgettable one. Or was the studio rabbiting in his ear?\u0085Makes you wonder why they pursued Woo in the first place. It\u0092s stretching credulity if Damon was cast as Jennings, only someone who\u0092s badass like me or Josh Holloway or Ralph Fiennes would stand a cat in hell\u0092s chance with Uma Thurman (I know she was in The Avengers with Fiennes, but we don\u0092t think about that!)

It makes it hard. Some people \u0096 and not just Michael \u0096 feel the need to create drama and tension and anxiety to get what they want. And Woo demonstrates that this is not true. He\u0092s the sweetest, humblest, most decent man.\u0094 \u0085<hr/></br></br></hr></blockquote> <br>Paycheck should stand as a model example of why a director shouldn\u0092t try to be something he or she\u0092s not. If he\u0092s going to do it, DON\u0092T hold back! Don\u0092t step outside your stylistic element/sensibilities! Stamp your fingerprints all over it! Go crazy! Yeah, people would\u0092ve still complained but at least the pic would\u0092ve been remembered as a cool curiosity and not a forgettable one. Or was the studio rabbiting in his ear?\u0085Makes you wonder why they pursued Woo in the first place. It\u0092s stretching credulity if Damon was cast as Jennings, only someone who\u0092s badass like me or Josh Holloway or Ralph Fiennes would stand a cat in hell\u0092s chance with Uma Thurman (I know she was in The Avengers with Fiennes, but we don\u0092t think about that!)

    "content": "Denis Dyack (Eternal Darkness, MGS: Twin Snakes): My favorite movie of all time is Blade Runner, I think it was well beyond its time. It really set the stage for science fiction for quite a while, and still does. I love movies so much this is always hard -- I keep a top 20, but it's changing all the time. I guess I like movies that are poignant and say something -- The Godfather, The Usual Suspects, Apocalypse Now. Those probably sound like stereotypes. Influences on my games \u0085 did you ever see Ninja Scroll? You know the fight scene, where the blind demon was fighting Jubei? From Samurai Shodown? [laughs] That fight scene influenced the fight between Kain...no, between Vorador and Malek in Legacy of Kain. I really liked the way the cinematography was designed in that, the way it flowed. That happens all the time. I believe that in our industry you have to immerse yourself in media, you have to know what's around you. Miyamoto Musashi, in the Book of Five Rings, said you have to \"know all the arts.\" You have to know music, you have to know movies, you have to know cinematography, all kinds of things. My favorite directors are people like James Cameron, I like a lot of his movies -- these are going to be stereotypes too. Steven Spielberg, I like some of his movies a lot, and hate some of his movies a lot. Stanley Kubrick's up there -- 2001, The Shining. I really strongly feel that you have to study the classics in order to progress -- that's sort of a theme in Eternal Darkness. By studying film -- and I think you really see that in Twin Snakes -- the cinematography is a big deal. The way that's done, the way you can create emotion and movie the audience to the point where they lose track of time and get immersed in the game, that's what we have to study. We just have to apply that now in nonlinear ways. Like with the camera system in a game ... you have to anticipate what a user's going to do. Source: http://www.1up.com/features/cinemascope_2  Michel Ancel (Rayman, Beyond Good & Evil): Pulp Fiction for the non conventional and upside-down scenario. Blade Runner because of this strange atmosphere of humanity vs. technology and darkness. Grave of the Fireflies because it touches you so strongly without big effects or technology, just with a sincere storytelling. I would also add Fight Club and Twelve Monkeys. All these movies are about darkness but a piece of humanity, of meaning. Terry Gilliam, Quentin Tarantino , Ethan and Joel Coen, Wim Wenders, Tom Tykwer -- all these directors are pushing the movie industry into new directions, innovations and use of visuals for an unconventional way of telling stories. We need these people's vision because they change our point of view. If you look at the same subject with the same point of view, the same rhythm, the same effects, you don't have the feeling of evolving. So these directors make us think in different ways, which is very interesting. The video game industry needs this kind of energy to be able to explore a lot of directions. Now for each new game, I'm trying to think about the point of view, the structure, in order to please and to surprise myself and the players. I like the fact that everything is possible in Pulp Fiction. The heroes can die, the bad guys can be heroes. It's just unpredictable and at the same time it's always logical. When the character of Bruce Willis escapes from the mafia guys, you think that he's free, that he did it. But that's wrong. He stops at a light, and who is crossing the street with a burger in his hand? The chief of the mafia! That's absolutely stupid and crazy, but it works. And the two guys start to fight in the street until they arrive in a small shop, and at this time, when you think that you have seen the worst things, it appears to be the beginning of the descent into hell. So you never know where the limits are. You're just like the people in the movie; you're under the director's control. In this kind of structure, surprise and contrast are connected and avoid making you bored by repetitive or too predictable things. Most of all, the fact that it's always logical or possible is very important in this movie. I think that we can add this kind of emotion in a game. In Beyond Good & Evil, we tried to add these kinds of events that sustain the player in a good story rhythm. Source: http://www.1up.com/features/cinemascope_2  Favorite video game? Movie?\r Jeremiah Palecek: Um, favorite video game. Well this is a two part answer. Favorite old school game would have to be Joust for the Atari 2600, and contemporary game I would have to say that I'm an absolute slave to Counterstrike. Counterstrike is like crack for gamers. Well, actually Quake is crack for gamers, but I like killing people instead of aliens. Favorite film would be toss up between Blade Runner, and the original Planet of the Apes.

Source: http://cg.creativefan.com/interview-with-jack-moik-of-magna-mana-fx/  - What were your influences ?\r Ivan Engler: My all time favourite movie is \u0093BLADE RUNNER\u0094. Next to a fantastic and very philosophical story, Ridley Scott transports so many moods, so many touching and dazzling snapshots of this unique future, that everytime I see the movie, the movie touches me not only by the emotional journeys the protagonists go through, but also by all its moods and moments. Same thing goes for \u0093ALIEN\u0094. So these two films were big and important influences for the creation of CARGO. Next to that, I am a big fan of Michelangelo Antonioni and Andrei Tarkovsky. Both these filmmakers were masters in creating moods and setting special tones, so they are like idols to me and I have seen all their films many times. I am also a fan of animated japanese movies like \u0093GHOST IN THE SHELL\u0094 and \u0093AKIRA\u0094. And of course, Stanley Kubrick and James Cameron were important influences as well \u0096 I grew up living next to a video rental store, and many of my afternoons were filled with just watching movies. I also read a lot of comic books, mostly french and belgian stuff. There are so many good stories in these books, I sometimes wonder why they are not made into films? On the literary side, I love Philip K. Dick (Do androids dream of electric sheep?), William Gibson (Neuromancer) and Neal Stephenson (Snow Crash). There is a pile of other SciFi books I wanted to read since a long time, like \u0093Diaspora\u0094 by Greg Egan and all the books by Tad Williams, but during the last years I did not have the time and inner peace to sit down and read. I am looking forward to this winter where I can sit in the warmth and read. Another very important influence for me is music and sound. I love the early ambient albums of Brian Eno, Michael Brook, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and the early Pink Floyd, very psychedelic, very inspiring for mind journeys. I love music that takes you onto a journey. I cannot stand the actual \u0093radio hit single\u0094, it makes me vomit. A good album should let you forget time and space and take you on a mind trip. I remember listening to Pink Floyds \u0093Welcome to the machine\u0094 when I was a 7 year old kid. I got up very early in the morning, just after christmas, and must have listened to the record at least 5 times already, when my mum dragged me out for a morning walk. Once outside, in the wintermorning fog, I suddenly saw two suns at the sky. Two suns! An emotional moment I will never forget. Of course, one of these \u0093suns\u0094 was the full moon that was still up, and behind the fog it looked like an additional sun. But from this moment on I was deeply fascinated by all things in space, by the infinite possibilities and infinite depths of space. And all this will always be connected with \u0093Welcome to the machine\u0094.

We live in the shadow of \"Blade Runner\", so you can't really deny it when, particuarly, we were really influenced by Soviet socialist cities and facist design. Propaganda and the industrial revolution. That all got mashed together with some futuristic concepts. We called it retro-futurism.\r Shock: It was shot with lenses from the '70's, too, right?\r Scott Stewart: Yeah, we used these anamorphic lenses which are rare now. You have to try and assemble a set of them. Then we had some new ones built for us. Don Burgess was my cameraman on the movie. Don shot \"Forrest Gump\" and \"Spider-Man\" and he was really excited to have a chance to go back and shoot anamorphic. The movies that I grew up loving, \"Blade Runner\" and \"Star Wars\" and \"Alien\" and some of the 70's westerns were shot with those lenses. They have flares and all sorts of nasty things that they've been trying to remove from lenses for years because they make visual effects harder. But they look great. They look beautiful. I love the flares and I love how distorted the image gets.\r http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/articlenews.php?id=18692   Karl Urban (Priest): And upon reading the script I met with director Scott Stewart and found myself to be quite in sync with him.

We live in the shadow of \"Blade Runner\", so you can't really deny it when, particuarly, we were really influenced by Soviet socialist cities and facist design. Propaganda and the industrial revolution. That all got mashed together with some futuristic concepts. We called it retro-futurism.\r<br> <br>Shock: It was shot with lenses from the '70's, too, right?\r<br> <br><b>Scott Stewart</b>: Yeah, we used these anamorphic lenses which are rare now. You have to try and assemble a set of them. Then we had some new ones built for us. Don Burgess was my cameraman on the movie. Don shot \"Forrest Gump\" and \"Spider-Man\" and he was really excited to have a chance to go back and shoot anamorphic. The movies that I grew up loving, \"Blade Runner\" and \"Star Wars\" and \"Alien\" and some of the 70's westerns were shot with those lenses. They have flares and all sorts of nasty things that they've been trying to remove from lenses for years because they make visual effects harder. But they look great. They look beautiful. I love the flares and I love how distorted the image gets.\r<br> <br><a href=\"http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/articlenews.php?id=18692\">http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/articlenews.php?id=18692</a> <br> <br> <br><b>Karl Urban</b> (Priest): And upon reading the script I met with director Scott Stewart and found myself to be quite in sync with him.

There are some films that I really enjoy such as Blade Runner, and they may have been helpful in making my movies to a certain degree, but I think many filmmakers consider so other than just myself. When you create a film dealing with humans and cyborgs, you have no choice but to refer back to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, as this movie is probably the foundation of movies with this theme.

There are some films that I really enjoy such as Blade Runner, and they may have been helpful in making my movies to a certain degree, but I think many filmmakers consider so other than just myself. When you create a film dealing with humans and cyborgs, you have no choice but to refer back to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, as this movie is probably the foundation of movies with this theme.

'Blade Runner' was always on, but this time [while] I watched them, I felt like I was - I felt we were on a bit of an artistic crisis at a certain point. We had done this recording, we [had] just gotten back from Japan and I had about, we had a week to ourselves maybe, to kind of contemplate what we're in the midst of in what we're doing. And I watched the 'Blade Runner' documentary, and that's actually called 'Dangerous Days', because that was the original title of 'Blade Runner'. And there's, just from watching that, I gained so much insight about art and what it took to not back down. And there's this thing where he's, in the very opening when the credits are happening, there's a shadow of Ridley Scott and he says: you see this in my hands, this is my camera, this is my weapon. He goes: I'm not gonna stop until I get what I want. And I was like: oh, God, you got to really dig deep like this guy, like he, we're gonna have to really do what he just said.

'Blade Runner' was huge during Parade as well. 'Blade Runner' was always on, but this time [while] I watched them, I felt like I was - I felt we were on a bit of an artistic crisis at a certain point. We had done this recording, we [had] just gotten back from Japan and I had about, we had a week to ourselves maybe, to kind of contemplate what we're in the midst of in what we're doing. And I watched the 'Blade Runner' documentary, and that's actually called 'Dangerous Days', because that was the original title of 'Blade Runner'. And there's, just from watching that, I gained so much insight about art and what it took to not back down. And there's this thing where he's, in the very opening when the credits are happening, there's a shadow of Ridley Scott and he says: you see this in my hands, this is my camera, this is my weapon. He goes: I'm not gonna stop until I get what I want. And I was like: oh, God, you got to really dig deep like this guy, like he, we're gonna have to really do what he just said. Had a huge impact on me just that documentary. 'Cause obviously, I've seen the film so much and there's a little bit of influence in there. There's a lot of Tokyo in there.

I love the themes it explores and from a visual aspect, I can't think of any other films that match it.

When I was 16, I saw Blade Runner for the first time. Looking back, I realize that film introduced me to the art of cinematography and the world of visual storytelling. I was staring at the images, mesmerized by the way Ridley Scott and the Director of Photography, Jordan Cronenweth, had managed to depict this futuristic and postmodern world in such a real and vivid way. I could smell the acidic rain flooding the streets of the mutant city of Los Angeles through the colors projected from the old CRT television set. This significant experience made me see the power and influence of films, and the role of cinematography within the process of visual storytelling. I wanted to be able to bring these kinds of images to life myself, to be able to depict a story in such a vivid and unique way that people would be able to smell it, to feel warm or cold, to feel they were practically there themselves.

When I was 16, I saw Blade Runner for the first time. Looking back, I realize that film introduced me to the art of cinematography and the world of visual storytelling. I was staring at the images, mesmerized by the way Ridley Scott and the Director of Photography, Jordan Cronenweth, had managed to depict this futuristic and postmodern world in such a real and vivid way. I could smell the acidic rain flooding the streets of the mutant city of Los Angeles through the colors projected from the old CRT television set. This significant experience made me see the power and influence of films, and the role of cinematography within the process of visual storytelling. I wanted to be able to bring these kinds of images to life myself, to be able to depict a story in such a vivid and unique way that people would be able to smell it, to feel warm or cold, to feel they were practically there themselves. When I look back at this now, I realize it was a defining moment in my life.\r<br> <br>What cinematographers inspired you to pick up a camera?\r<br> <br>Jordan Cronenweth\r<br> <br>Blade Runner might be Cronenweth\u2019s only film that I like, or love I should say.

The decay of Ridley Scott's dystopian future spilled over into the rodent-rich, un-gentrified, occasionally threatening Lower East Side of the time.<hr/></hr></blockquote> <br><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/john-oreilly/re-imagining-our-cities_b_8113520.html\">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/john-oreilly/re-imagining-our-cities_b_8113520.html</a> <br> <br> <br> <b><font color=\"blue\"><i>Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.</i></font></b></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n</div>",

I mean I love the original but I\u2019m surprised at how much interest there is when the original actually wasn\u2019t commercially very successful and wasn\u2019t critically very successful as well. So that tells you a lot about a movie\u2019s staying power.\r<br> <br>Did you know the original film\u2019s DP, Jordan Cronenweth, at all?\r<br> <br><b>Roger Deakins</b>: I\u2019d never met Jordan, no. Unless I met him when I was in England once but I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t remember meeting him.\r<br> <br>His work on that film is pretty iconic.\r<br> <br><b>Roger Deakins</b>: Yeah, yeah. Quite brilliant. I mean obviously there\u2019s a lot of Ridley in that, too. It\u2019s great to work with a director who really wanted to push for that look. I remember distinctly when it came out and how strong that look was when compared with other movies that were around at the time.\r<br> <br><a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/in-contention/roger-deakins-sicario-interview-denis-villeneuve-1201601102/\">http://variety.com/2015/film/in-contention/roger-deakins-sicario-interview-denis-villeneuve-1201601102/</a></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n</div>",

My life is 100 percent Blade Runner right now, so I\u2019m in the future, I\u2019m not with you anymore. \r What does it mean for your life to be 100 percent Blade Runner?   I wake up at six, I get to bed at midnight, it\u2019s like seven days a week and you dream about it. Very often I wake up in the middle of the night, and I know I\u2019m doomed, because I know I won\u2019t go back to bed, because I\u2019m too excited, there\u2019s so much work. So I don\u2019t sleep a lot. So that\u2019s why if you ask me what I\u2019m going to do after Blade Runner, I\u2019m going to sleep. \r With Blade Runner, will the visual language pay tribute to the original, or will it be something completely your own? Do you feel pressure to live up to the original?   First of all, it\u2019s not possible to live up to the original. It\u2019s Ridley Scott. It\u2019s a masterpiece. It\u2019s one of the best sci-fi films, one of the best films in the past 50 years. \r For me, what terrorizes me right now is what I\u2019m doing is taking Blade Runner and making it my own, and that is horrific. To realize that when I look at the dailies, it\u2019s not Ridley Scott, it\u2019s me, and that it\u2019s different. It\u2019s still the same universe, we are still in the same dream, but it\u2019s mine, so it\u2019s like I have no idea how you people will react, I don\u2019t know. It has its own life. \r How has it been working with Ryan Gosling?   I must say, the thing I can say is that Ryan Gosling is insanely good. I\u2019m very impressed by that actor. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve worked with him and I never had someone that was as much a trooper, as dedicated, as precise and engaged. I feel that he is a real partner with me. I said to him, \"You know, we are going to do it together and it\u2019s like walking in a dark room with a lighter trying to find the way out. It\u2019s a huge room and we are alone and it\u2019s dark and it\u2019s cold.\" And he said, \"Yeah, I understand exactly.\" But we have a lot of fun. \r It\u2019s funny because very often we say that nobody realizes that a bunch of Canadians took over Blade Runner. We are, like, covert, nobody knows. I knew he was a great actor, I didn\u2019t know how brilliant \u2014 he\u2019s really an intelligent person, very clever, very provocative mind, he\u2019s bringing a lot to the project right now, a lot, in a positive way. I\u2019m very excited about it. \r And what\u2019s it like to work with Harrison Ford?   It\u2019s a long shoot, and I started prep with him, but I didn\u2019t start to shoot with him. But I will say that Harrison, to my great relief \u2026 you know Harrison Ford, he was one of my biggest heroes. I grew up with him, so to meet a man like that who is kind of a legend in your heart, that has that kind of humility, generosity, open-mindedness and simplicity, one of the nicest human beings I\u2019ve met. I\u2019m really looking forward to start working with him. \r What are your top three science-fiction films?   2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Blade Runner \u2026 so you can see that I\u2019m in deep *beep*\r The rest of the interview is about ARRIVAL: http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/venice-arrival-director-denis-villeneuve-925854   - taken from the other message board\r  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdTmT3wVBxM someone should remake hollywood",

It\u2019s one of the best sci-fi films, one of the best films in the past 50 years. \r<br> <br>For me, what terrorizes me right now is what I\u2019m doing is taking Blade Runner and making it my own, and that is horrific. To realize that when I look at the dailies, it\u2019s not Ridley Scott, it\u2019s me, and that it\u2019s different. It\u2019s still the same universe, we are still in the same dream, but it\u2019s mine, so it\u2019s like I have no idea how you people will react, I don\u2019t know. It has its own life. \r<br> <br><b>How has it been working with Ryan Gosling? </b> <br> <br>I must say, the thing I can say is that Ryan Gosling is insanely good. I\u2019m very impressed by that actor. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve worked with him and I never had someone that was as much a trooper, as dedicated, as precise and engaged. I feel that he is a real partner with me. I said to him, \"You know, we are going to do it together and it\u2019s like walking in a dark room with a lighter trying to find the way out. It\u2019s a huge room and we are alone and it\u2019s dark and it\u2019s cold.\" And he said, \"Yeah, I understand exactly.\" But we have a lot of fun. \r<br> <br>It\u2019s funny because very often we say that nobody realizes that a bunch of Canadians took over Blade Runner. We are, like, covert, nobody knows. I knew he was a great actor, I didn\u2019t know how brilliant \u2014 he\u2019s really an intelligent person, very clever, very provocative mind, he\u2019s bringing a lot to the project right now, a lot, in a positive way. I\u2019m very excited about it. \r<br> <br><b>And what\u2019s it like to work with Harrison Ford? </b> <br> <br>It\u2019s a long shoot, and I started prep with him, but I didn\u2019t start to shoot with him. But I will say that Harrison, to my great relief \u2026 you know Harrison Ford, he was one of my biggest heroes. I grew up with him, so to meet a man like that who is kind of a legend in your heart, that has that kind of humility, generosity, open-mindedness and simplicity, one of the nicest human beings I\u2019ve met. I\u2019m really looking forward to start working with him. \r<br> <br><b>What are your top three science-fiction films? </b> <br> <br>2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Blade Runner \u2026 so you can see that I\u2019m in deep *beep*\r<br> <br>The rest of the interview is about ARRIVAL: <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/venice-arrival-director-denis-villeneuve-925854\">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/venice-arrival-director-denis-villeneuve-925854 </a> <br> <br>- taken from the other message board\r<br> <br> <blockquote><hr><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdTmT3wVBxM\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdTmT3wVBxM</a> someone should remake hollywood<hr/></hr></blockquote></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n</div>",
